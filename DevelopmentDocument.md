DEVELOPMENT DOCUMENT

To realize the project, I can spend 1 week to build the structure by taking into consideration of human centered design methods with my mentors. Then, I can divide the process 4 quarters:

- 1st quarter: to build the digital sound synthesis part.
- 2nd quarter: to create visual interaction part.
- 3rt quarter: to combine first two part.
- 4th quarter: to make demo, fix technical problems and develop user feedbacks.

Between the fellowship duration I can devote half of my time in week and all my energy.
